This value is not directly useable as a blood glucose measurement. There is a physiological \" delay \" between capillary blood glucose and interstitial glucose concentrations and they tend to be proportional after a certain time. We assume 10 minutes at stable BG is a reasonable time to reduce inaccuracy. In order to use raw data as blood glucose equivalent you need to give it a reference. Unless the sensor has a native calibration computation (also called factory calibration) it will not match real BG. Proprietary calibration algorithms \u2301 Some vendors provide factory calibrated sensors (G6 and Libre) that might fail to reach the expected accuracy. Where the first one allows you to apply native mode calibration, the second cannot be calibrated with the vendor app. Native mode calibration \u2301 G6 sensors are factory calibrated, you will enter the calibration code at startup. Should you want to calibrate, xDrip+ will only send the calibration data to the sensor transmitter for elaboration: it will not apply any local algorithm. xDrip+ in native mode relies on the transmitter data, this is why your receiver (if you own one) will display the same data. More information here . When calibrating is dangerous \u2301 Calibrating when BG is not stable will generate bad calibrations hence bad BG data you cannot rely on. Calibrating at flat curve BG is extremely dangerous as this means your sensor is out of range or mulfunctioning and raw data doesn't represent blood glucose at all. xDrip+ calibration algorithm \u2301 Intercept \u2301 If you measure your blood glucose with a glucometer and it shows 130 mg/dl stable and 10 minutes after your CGM reads 100 you will want to calibrate. This is how to tell xDrip+ that a raw value of 130 means a real value of 100. Calibrating in these conditions will show a calibration graph theoretically looking like this: Which translates as: calibrated BG will be raw value minus 30. -30 is called the intercept , that is an offset between raw value and calibrated BG. Intercept will weight more on lower BG measurement, it is recommended to have it as accurate as possible to make sure xDrip+ is accurate in the low range, that is used for your safety. Perform sensor first calibration with BG stable in the lower normal range (90 to 120 mg/dl - 5 to 7 mmol/l) . The value of intercept will move your calibrated BG up and down. Slope \u2301 Using the calibration above, you might have inaccuracy with readings when raw value is very different ... for example xDrip+ will display 170 mg/dl and your glucometer 205 mg/dl. The offset is different with higher BG in this case... it is raw value plus 5... In order to make xDrip+ accurate in this BG range, you need to add another calibration point. Once done your curve will change theoretically like this: You see the red line is steeper and the slope parameter increased. In this case, a slope of 1.5 means a smaller variation in raw value will make a larger variation in BG value displayed by xDrip+. Slope will weight more on higher BG measurement, if you need accuracy on higher BG values add a calibration point in the upper range. Add a higher calibration value at stable higher BG in the upper normal range, do not use too high blood glucose to calibrate (180 to 220 mg/dl - 10 to 12 mmol/l). This slope is a coefficient that multiplies raw value, it is similar to a gain . It will increase or decrease BG sensitivity to raw data. Maths, models and real life \u2301 Your calibration curve is the result of a mathematical calculation that tries to find a line that fits the best all provided calibration points, minimizing the distance between each point and the theoretical line. Its quality will depend on your sensor and your calibration strategy. If your sensor is noisy or you don't calibrate at stable BG, the algorithm will have difficulties to fit all data and result in an inaccurate calibration curve: you can't get a line to be close to all points in a cloud of calibrations. Interstitial \"delay\" \u2301 This is probably the most complex factor to take into account when calibrating, this is why stable BG is key. There is a delay between capillary BG and interstitial liquid glucose concentration, there are also other parameters that will make it evolve differently, like physical activity, ... Since this delay can't be known nor guessed by xDrip+, calibrating with fast changing BG will not work.

You can decide to use treatments as calibrations. Warning Always use treatments as calibrations is not recommended . Automatic mode will only suggest you to use the treatment as a calibration if xDrip+ detects that current conditions are good to calibrate (like BG stable for 20 minutes, low noise). It might also suggest to you enable automatic calibration. It is not recommended to use this feature with G6 sensors. Ask me every time will do exactly this every time you enter a BG treatment. Never use treatments will never use them to calibrate (and will prevent you from transforming a treatment into a calibration). Automatic Calibration \u2301 It is recommended to disable this for G6 sensors . Automatic calibration will accept a treatment as a calibration if it satisfies the conditions of a flat trend for 20 minutes. Plugins \u2301 Calibration plugins are available in xDrip+, most are not used anymore. If enabled, a plugin acts instead of the standard xDrip+ calibration.

A flat line (same number) is never a good sign. General considerations \u2301 Calibration is key to CGM mesurement accuracy. Always use a trusted glucometer and make sure you put yourself in the best conditions to have the most accurate blood reading when calibrating. Some of the most important prerequisites are: Stable BG. Never calibrate when BG is rising or falling rapidly. In range (important for Libre initial calibration). Try to perform your calibrations when BG is within normal range (80-180 mg/dl or 5-10 mmol/l). Don't overcalibrate. Better few accurate than too many: you will most probably confuse xDrip+. For G4, G5 and G6 use the vendor recommendations. Native and xDrip+ algorithms \u2301 xDrip+ can provide its own calibrations algorithms for sensors sending raw data. G5 and G6 native calibration means that xDrip+ will not use its algorithm but will send calibration values to the transmitter and let it handle it with its own proprietary algorithm. Libre sensors only send raw data, and will need either xDrip+ calibration or an external calibration plugin called out of process algorithm (short OOP). Libre 2 patched app will use its own proprietary algorithm (an old version though). Sensor xDrip+ calibration Native calibration G4 Mandatory Not available G5 Available Available G6 old (80/81 series) Available Available G6 new ( Firefly ) Not available Mandatory Libre 1 Mandatory OOP1 Libre 14 days US Not available OOP1 US (obsolete) Libre 2 EU patched app Limited offset (see below) By design Libre 2 EU, Libre 14 days US Optional OOP2 Libre 2 patched app \u2301 When using the patched app, you can calibrate but correction is applied as an offset with maximum values between -40 mg/dl to +20 mg/dL [-2,2 mmol/l to +1,1 mmol/l] xDrip+ calibration settings \u2301 xDrip+ calibration only The information below is relevant to xDrip+ calibration. For G5 and G6 native mode see here . Before calibrating check your settings . One thing you want to enable is data tables in the main menu. This will really help understanding when things go wrong. First calibration \u2301 If your sensor requires calibrations, after connecting it to xDrip+ and receiving three values you should see this request: Two values initial calibration values are historical from G4. If you want to use that correctly: make two different measurements (two strips), this is a recommended approach. If you usually insert the same value you might want to make it a default here . If you're using native calibration, the value will be sent to the transmitter for processing. If you're using xDrip+ calibration, this value will be processed 10 minutes later to make sure to compensate for all physiological and chemical delays of the CGM measurement, this is why it's extremely important to calibrate at stable BG . Let's look graphically at what will happen on the main view: First reading (brought to calibration value) Second reading (brought to calibration value) Not visible yet but it's the third reading. The actual value when you calibrated Next reading in 5 minutes Next reading in 10 minutes and the calibration point (that will be used in 10 minutes) If your BG remained stable during this time you should see it go through the calibration point.

When troubleshooting don't hesitate to turn it off then on to restart it. The watch mac address should be detected automatically when the field is left empty. You can manually edit it and write the 6 two-digits hex values, colon separated, of your watch. When a valid mac address is found you will also see the key field. If it's not filled automatically you can manually enter the 32 characters authentication key. You must enable this to have readings sent to the watch. You can enable various options to have the watch vibrate on readings, receive alarms or receive notifications as phone calls. You can force watchface refresh using Update BG manually.

Enable wear allows the watch to take over from the phone when the phone xDrip+ is losing connection to the sensor/bridge. Force wear is forcing the watch to act as the main device connected to the sensor/bridge even if the phone is nearby (recommended). Disable force on low battery will make the watch drop sensor/bridge connection to give it back to the phone when its battery level is too low. Disable force on missed readings will make the watch drop sensor/bridge connection to give it back to the phone after a certain time of missed readings, defined in the menu below. Only use wear can be enabled if you have setup the watch once but will not use your phone to connect to the sensor/bridge. If you have several Android Wear smartwatch with xDrip+, you can select which one will be the collector. The other will only display xDrip+ data.

Recommended sequence \u2301 First time attempt or failure recovery: On your phone xDrip+: disable force collector, then disable collection, then disable Wear. Enable wear logs. Restart your smartwatch. Wait until it's fully running. On you phone enable only Wear. Wait until the xDrip+ graph is fully displayed on the watch (waiting for a new measurement doesn't hurt). Make sure you keep phone, watch and sensor close together and enable first collection then force collector.

Fun fact You can use some of these methods with the Dexcom master app and AAPS. Prerequisites \u2301 Your watch needs to be compliant with Android Wear OS and bear the following logo: Recent watches can be found here . All Wear OS smartwatches are directly compatible with xDrip+ but Google changes have made it more complex to install it. Wear OS versions \u2301 Legacy Wear OS like 1.5 and 1.6 are now more complex to use with modern phones. Wear OS 2 and 3 are fully supported. Wear OS 1.x \u2301 Usually it's the Sony Smartwatch 3 ( SWR50 ). Method 1 (easiest) \u2301 Unpair the watch from your phone if it was already paired. Uninstall Wear OS from your phone if it is installed. If you have other Android Wear watches connected you might need to pair them again. Disable the Google Play apps auto-update feature. Install Android Wear 2.9.0.185084575 GMS . Open Android Wear and pair the watch, accept and allow everything: if you want to disable some features you'll do that when you're done with xDrip+ install. When pairing completes check your watch Google Play version is above 9 . Settings -> About -> Versions If it isn't: tap it 3 times to force update, and wait (up to hours). Select an xDrip+ watchface on the phone Android Wear app Enable Google Play apps Auto-update and update manually to Wear OS . Method 2 (with a computer) \u2301 Install Wear OS and pair the watch to your phone. Check your watch Google Play services version is above 9 (manufacturing default for latest firmware is 8.7). Settings -> About -> Versions If it is, you're done: see above how to select an xDrip+ watchface. Else continue below. Download a more recent version of Google Play services. Rename the file to a shorter name, like GPS.apk . Install ADB and sideload it to the watch . Wear OS 2.x and 3.x \u2301 Method 1 (easiest) \u2301 This might not be always possible to complete this procedure, if it fails try Method 2. Unpair the watch from your phone if it was already paired. Uninstall Wear OS from your phone if it is installed. If you have other Android Wear watches connected you might need to pair them again. Disable the Google Play apps auto-update feature. Install an old version of Wear OS 2.51.0.398446042.gms . Open Android Wear and pair the watch, accept and allow everything: if you want to disable some features you'll do that when you're done with xDrip+ install. On the watch, open Settings, Aps & Notifications, App Info, System Apps and search Google Play Store. Select Remove Upgrades. Confirm. (Note the watch will automatically upgrade its app, you need to be fast once downgraded.) On the watch, open Google Play Store and scroll to Apps on my Phone. Select and install xDrip+. Change the watchface to an xDrip+ one with a long touch on the current watchface. Method 2 (best) \u2301 Recommended: follow this video that details the process. You need to be connected to Wi-Fi. So should your watch. Install Wear OS and pair your watch. Install and open Wear Installer on your phone. Enable Developer mode on the watch (Instructions here . Only on the watch, then come back) Enable ADB Debug over Wi-Fi on the Watch. Install Wear Installer on your watch. Open the app on the watch and copy the IP address to the app on the phone. Tape Done Select xDrip+ Wear Installer will extract the wear smartwatch apk. Make sure to accept debug authorisation on your watch if required. Once ready, select INSTALL and let the app do its work without interfering, it might take a few minutes to complete. Look for messages during the process but don't interfere. When complete, select FINISH . If xDrip+ failed to install on the watch, try again. Method 3 (with a computer) \u2301 Install ADB . Download xDrip+ on a computer and extract the APK (it's a zipped file). It must be exactly the same version you have on your phone. Browse the the /res/raw folder of the xDrip+ package and copy the file android_wear_micro_apk.apk into your ADB folder. Sideload the xDrip+ wear extension to the watch. Update xDrip+ on your watch \u2301 Wear OS 1.x \u2301 To force the watch app to update, just synchronize all apps. Wear OS 2.0 and above \u2301 You will need to uninstall and reinstall the wear app every time you want to update your phone xDrip+ in order to maintain the apps sync'ed. Starting with April 13th 2021, xDrip+ can automatically update your wear version if you already have a compatible version installed (which is minimum Nightly build 13th Apr 2021 ). For the updated version the instructions are as follows: Install the latest nightly xDrip WearOs component to the watch, eg using Wear Installer app, downgrading play store or via adb manually (see above). Make sure developer mode and wifi adb debugging are enabled on the Watch (see above: Wear OS 2 Method 2 step 4) Go to xDrip Prefs on the Watch, scroll till you see Force Update - tap it It should check ADB, and ask for authorization, select Always Allow Probably it will tell you ADB isn't working due to needing the authorization Go in to xDrip Prefs again on the watch and click Force Update This time it should say ADB looks good and then ask xDrip phone app to send the latest version This should download and then xDrip will install itself. When the versions are identical this wont really do much, but this process can be used to force xDrip to send the latest version in future but it should also automatically detect version changes and update in the background. For fun you could install the latest nightly on the watch then downgrade your phone and check that the update process then downgrades your watch app version. The version information should be displayed next to the Force Update text. The idea is that you no longer need to use Wear Installer or whatever method you used to install the first time around (eg PC based adb or downgrading play store) as xDrip can update itself.

They're all based on the LimiTTer concept and the blueReader implementation: an NFC reading chip CR95LF and a Nordic Semiconductors BLE microcontroller. The first one reads the sensor and the second one sends data through Bluetooth to your phone (or Wear watch) every 5 minutes. Note As long as your bridge can read the sensor and transmit data you can assume it is working correctly. When xDrip+ shows missing readings you need to understand what is failing. This is not always easy. Info Start with simple things: first restart your phone. Since you're here, check your xDrip+ Bluetooth parameters and don't hesitate to disable some. Then go to System Status and also BT device. If you don't know how, look here first. Classis Status Page \u2301 If your bridge shows as LimiTTer it probably means it's not connected or not recognized. All devices report as LimiTTer until connected, only Libre 2 direct connection and some older bridges (Transmitter_T for example) will remain indicated as LimiTTer (and obviously LimiTTer itself). Check xDrip+ version and make sure it's recent enough to support the bridge you're connecting to. There are too many versions and improvements in xDrip+ to give an accurate table of minimum required versions. Make sure you use at least the latest release version of xDrip+ and if you think your bridge requires more recent features, try to update to the latest pre-release . Don't uninstall xDrip+ when you want to change version. You can easily go back and forth between versions without losing data and settings. BT Device Page \u2301 Swipe the screen towards the left to display the BT Device page. Bluetooth Pairing \u2301 If you've been here before: Bluetooth pairing should be disabled, if you changed this by mistake: touch the line to return it to this state: Bluetooth Device \u2301 Bluetooth should always be connected. First actions to perform if Bluetooth is not connected: Check your Bluetooth settings and Restart collector . If restart collector allowed you to recover connection, the issue might be with your Bluetooth settings or phone energy savings settings. Open Android Settings -> Apps -> xDrip+: make sure it can run in background and is not optimized for battery savings. Still in Apps look for Bluetooth system apps (might be hidden by default and present in the three dots menu, upper right): make sure all Bluetooth services can run in background and are not optimized. If the bridge device still isn't visible try to Scan Bluetooth to find it. If scan Bluetooth doesn't find it continue here . If scan Bluetooth allows you to select it but it doesn't remain connected continue here . Phone Service State \u2301 Phone service state gives the last time data was received from the bridge, it should be less than 5 minutes ago. Next wake up will count down to the next expected data to be received, then restart at 5 minutes. If you've setup an Android Wear watch as a collector go to the matching troubleshooting page. If you don't own an Android Wear watch with xDrip+ correctly installed on it, disable Wear collector . Do not attempt to connect your bridge to a smartwatch until you have a reliable behavior with your phone (no connection loss). Bridge information \u2301 You will also see various information on the bridge like Mac address, hardware and firmware version. Note that battery level is not available on Blucon bridges and 100% will only mean that it's still usable. It is strongly recommended to upgrade your device firmware to the latest available version. No Sensor Found \u2301 No sensor found errors are usually due to bad positioning of the bridge over the sensor. Some bridges do not have any tolerance in respect with distance and angle to the sensor antenna area. It might also be due to an internal bridge issue, firmware issue, ... Since this is a persistent message, check the time indicated is recent. If it is permanently 5 minutes ago, the sensor is not seen. If it happened a few hours ago, just ignore it. If you're using a bridge that isn't sensitive to positioning, it might have an internal failure or firmware corruption. First reset it and charge it completely. Try to reload or update its firmware. If you're using a sensor that is not a Libre 1, you might need to add an Out Of Process algorithm. Forget Device in xDrip+, install the vendor app to exclude a device failure. Contact the vendor for support. Bluetooth scan doesn't find the bridge \u2301 Note This is absolutely normal when your bridge is connected to xDrip+. Make sure it's not paired to another phone or another app. If you use the bridge with another app, remove it from the app or uninstall the app that connects to it. If you used the bridge on another phone, power it off now or remove the app that was connecting to your bridge. Reset it. Contact the vendor to know how to do that. Put it in charge or replace the battery. You can scan Bluetooth with your device in charge and if you only can connect to it whilst charging, the internal battery might be dead. Install the vendor app to exclude a device failure. Contact the vendor for support.

Low alerts will trigger when BG is equal or below the alert value, high alerts when BG is equal or above. To create a new alert, touch the CREATE LOW or HIGH ALERT title bar. To modify an existing alert, long touch the alert You can name an alert the name you want, as long as no other alert has the same name The threshold is the BG level that will trigger the alarm, only one alarm can use this value Default snooze is the delay that will be proposed when snoozing The alarm will trigger again every x minutes if not acknowledged You can customize the alert sound: touch CHOOSE FILE System sound will allow you to choose from your phone ringtones, custom sound allows you to pick your sound/music and xDrip default sound uses the app default. By default the alarm will be setup for the whole day. If you unselect the checkbox you can customize activity hours (when to enable it).

Glucose Alerts Settings \u2301 Alert volume settings \u2301 You can customize the volume of your alerts Ascending volume is recommended if you don't want the alarm to blare immediately (useful during the night). Audio Focus \u2301 Audio Focus allows you to decide how to handle other sounds when an xDrip+ alarm or alert triggers. You can automatically lower the volume, pause the other apps playing sounds (like media players) or pause all other sounds in order to better focus on xDrip+ sound. Smart snoozing \u2301 Smart alerting \u2301 Smart snoozing and alerting avoid the alert to trigger or re-raise if BG is going in the right direction (upwards for low alerts and downwards for highs) Don't alarm during phone calls \u2301 Alarms will not sound if they trigger during a phone call. Buttons silence alarms \u2301 Button silence alarms is a quick way to snooze alarms by just pressing volume up or down. Alert buttons \u2301 Alert button will add an action button in the drop down view of the alert. Start snoozed \u2301 Start snoozed applies the snooze delay before triggering the alarm. Make sure the Default snooze delay is appropriate in the alarm. Wake Screen \u2301 Wake up screen during alerts. Use Camera Light \u2301 Flash the back camera light during alerts (when the phone is in charge). Glucose Level Alert List \u2301 You can add a additional line to Glucose Level Alert List in the main menu. Suppress alerts if missed readings \u2301 Level alerts remain active even if there is no signal (sensor change for example, or follower without network). This option allows you to suppress them. Make sure you have a missed alert enabled if you use this feature. Suppress snoozed and active alerts \u2301 You can also suppress alerts after a certain amount of time, make sure this is really what you want. Notification channel \u2301 With Android 8 and above you can use the notification channels for your alerts. This will allow you to customize notifications at Android level. In order to setup this feature, go to Android Settings / Notifications / Apps / xDrip+ and allow sound and vibration. You'll then be able to decide each notification behaviour. If you have multiple notification and alarms, disable the unwanted ones here. Delay ascending volume \u2301 You can delay the start of the ascending volume alert without delaying vibration that will start as soon as the alert is triggered. Calibration Alerts \u2301 If your sensor requires periodic calibration you can setup xDrip+ to alert you when calibration is due. You can setup the period between calibrations, sound to be played, ... Initial alert \u2301 Initial calibration alert is used when starting a sensor requiring initial calibration, it will trigger when enough readings are available to calibrate. Missed Reading Alert \u2301 When relying on xDrip+ to alert you for lows and highs, it is essential to make sure that it is actually receiving BG readings. For this, if you don't have any other alarms enable this feature for your safety. Setup is similar to glucose level alerts . The alarm sound has to be defined in Other Alerts (See below). In order to test it put your phone in airplane mode until it triggers. Other Alerts \u2301 If you enabled this feature and your sensor supports it, you can setup an alert for noisy readings. Falling or rising BG \u2301 You can also setup alerts for fast BG changes. Alert preferences \u2301 The alerts above and also Missed Readings use the sound defined below. Some recent Android versions do not ring it unless you use Notification channels . Extra Alerts \u2301 Persistent high \u2301 Instead of a high alert that will trigger as soon as BG reaches the trigger value, you can setup a persistent high alert that will only trigger when BG remains above the setup value for more than a certain time. Forecasted low \u2301 You can set an alarm on forecasted low value. This feature will use the momentum (extrapolation of the current BG trend) and not the prediction settings. Forecasted low (min) is the time in which a low will be forecasted (the one that usually displays in yellow on the graph screen). In the example below if you set Alarm at forecasted low (min) to 50 minutes, il will trigger. The red dotted line is the forecasted BG trend, extrapolated from the previous measurements. Other xDrip+ alerts \u2301 Some extra alerts are available. Battery alerts are available if your bridge sends this information to xDrip+. Sensor expiry alerts \u2301 Enable a notification when the sensor is close to expiry time. Snooze Alert \u2301 If there is no active alert, you can pre-snooze alerts from this menu so that they won't trigger for a certain time. You will be proposed a default snooze period. If an alert triggers you will see the notification in your phone drop down panel, and eventually hear the sound. You can snooze the alert swiping the notification, you can customize it further tapping it. You can access the snooze menu by touching the notification or from xDrip+ main menu, snooze alert. At this point, the snooze menu will also display the active alert. Touching snooze will snooze it for the period selected. ALL ALERTS CURRENTLY DISABLED \u2301 If you pre-snooze (disable) all alerts, you will see this warning message. To remove it you need to re-enable alerts. Visible alert notification \u2301 Available for Android 8 and above. When an alert triggers you will see it in the notifications drop down panel. Swiping it will snooze it, touching it will open a preferences menu. Deliver quietly will remove notifications channel sound and vibration. You can restore it with allow sound and vibration with the notifications channel . Settings will drive you to your phone notifications setup settings. You can also completely turn off notifications channel for xDrip+.

Last modified 3/5/2023","title":"Visible alert notification"},{"location":"use/bluetooth/","text":"The amount of Android phones manufacturers and sensors/bridges particularities has made Bluetooth connection reliability a major difficulty for xDrip+. This menu contains a lot of deep settings that cannot be standardized for all systems. Trial and error approach is recommended, but change only one setting at a time to avoid further confusion. If xDrip+ is connecting to a Bluetooth device, Turn Bluetooth On is mandatory. xDrip+ might not be able to fully override your phone settings, meaning that if you disable Bluetooth in Android settings or put your phone in airplane mode it might not be able to turn it on. Bluetooth must be enabled in Android settings if you want xDrip+ to use it. This option will make xDrip+ try to enable Bluetooth. In case of missing data you can make xDrip+ switch off then on your phone Bluetooth, default timing is 20 minutes without data. You can customize this value. Info Mind the Bluetooth watchdog ang G5 Bluetooth watchdog activating will lead to a temporary Bluetooth disconnection on all connected devices. You might want to disable this feature if you use AAPS and your bridge/pump doesn't recover automatically Bluetooth connection. If you see the message that xDrip+ turned off Bluetooth this is probably because watchdog triggered and is trying to recover connection with the sensor. For G5 sensors you can systematically have xDrip+ turn off and on Bluetooth. Keep it enabled if you have connection issues. When this option is enabled, xDrip+ will go through complete disconnection then reconnection of your bluetooth device (close link, discover and connect) when connection is lost. Since this might not be efficient, it is recommended to leave it disabled so that it's maintained in memory and will only try to connect back to it as a known BLE device. Use scanning will perform the equivalent of Bluetooth Scan from the main menu to attempt recovering a lost connection. This is not always efficient with newer phones. Leave it initially disabled unless it proves useful. Trust Auto-Connect really depends on your phone. If you have a Samsung phone you should leave it disabled. If you frequently lose connection and can't manage to recover leave it disabled . Use Background scan is a feature of newer Android versions. If you regularly lose connection, leave it disabled . Companion Bluetooth allows the app to work connected together with the Dex master app connected to the sensor. Bluetooth wakelocks are not recommended and should be left disabled . Constantly reset Bluetooth is not recommended. Leave it disabled , If you use a Transmitter_T or a Droplet bridge for Libre sensors you must enable this option else leave it disabled . RFDuino support is only necessary if you use a DIY bridge with RFDuino . Obsolete. Leave disabled . xBridge+ polling mode allows xDrip+ to send requests to the bridge. Even if it doesn't have any effect with other Bluetooth devices you can leave it enabled if you have frequent connection loss as it will anyway keep your phone Bluetooth busy trying to connect. Enabled by default. Allow BluCon unbonding is only useful if you use a BluCon bridge as others don't bond with your phone.

Make sure to re-read the EULA before enabling it. Do not use them to take medical decisions. Warning If you use a closed-loop system do not rely on these predictions since they don't take into account basal modulation. Enabling predictions will add the light purple prediction curve on the main graph. This curve is showing you how your BG should theoretically evolve using current insulin and carbs entered in xDrip+. More details on display here . xDrip+ can handle multiple insulin types. See below . Carb ratio and insulin sensitivity \u2301 Automatic import If you use accepting treatments from AAPS or NSClient, these parameters and the basal profile will automatically import at profile switch. Carb absorbtion rate \u2301 These parameters are key to diabetes management and should be known. They will most probably vary during the day and should be calculated for every meal and also outside meal times. Everybody has his own parameters. Don't use other people's parameters. Touching one of the two menus above will open the treatment profile editor. You can define carbs per units of insulin and correction factor, just remember to validate the entry and not jump from one line to another without confirming an entry. Save when finished. You will create blocks of for different hours during the day. To create (split) or delete a block, long touch the upper area of the block. Touching the time bar at the top of a block allows you to change it, it also will propagate to the block below. Eventually you'll end up having something like this.

Select the profile you want to modify or view Export (not functional yet) Save locally To edit your basal profile: Touch the basal hour bar you want to modify, it will turn orange Change the step if necessary Use the positive numbered box or the upwards arrow to increase Use the negative numbered box or the downwards arrow to decrease Use set, or double tap the bar to set the new value Use trend momentum \u2301 Trend momentum is independent from predictions, it is just a mathematical extrapolation (i.e. if BG continues to evolve with his trend, not considering insulin and carbs, where will it go?) of your current BG trend (up/down/flat). It can be used for Forecasted Low alarms . Trend momentum can be integrated in predictions (recommended). Including current trend (1) can prevent sharp prediction variations and might be closer to real evolution (2). Might EULA \u2301 Review the EULA before using this feature. Low Level prediction \u2301 You can setup more prediction parameters here. Target is used for bolus wizard calculator. This is the desired BG target. Insulin duration depends on your insuline type. Changing the value requires xDrip+ restart (or phone restart). Liver parameters were introduced to take into account liver glycogen reaction to lows but are not characterizable easily and should be left at default values. Multiple insulin types \u2301 Select the insulin types you are using. You can select up to three insulin types and then decide which one is used basal and which for bolus. When adding multiple insulin type, using treatments will ask you to select the one you're using for this treatment. You can add basal insulin on the display and integrate it in calculation. Not recommended as basal insulin in MDI is only used to keep background BG constant. Use notes to track basal injections.

Absolute numbers counts the number of measurements in range, above and below. Median BG is the central value of your data: same amount of measurements above and same below. Mean BG is the mathematical average of all measurements. Estimated HbA1c is only a mathematical calculation based on the average BG, and converted in mmol/mol or percent. StdDev or standard deviation is the mathematical result of the calculation. It shows the dispersion of your BG. Relative SD (CV) is the StdDev divided by mean and also shows the dispersion of your measurements. GVI and PGS were parameters introduced by Dexcom see here .
