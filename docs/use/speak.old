!!!xdrip "<img src="../../images/hamburger_menu.png" style="zoom:75%;" />"  
    &ensp;Settings  
    &emsp;<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/master/app/src/main/res/drawable-xhdpi/ic_speak_reading_grey600_48dp.png" style="width:5%;" />&ensp;Speak Readings

If you phone supports text to speech, you can have xDrip+ verbally read various events for you.

!!!xdripitem "Speak Readings <span class='symbol'><img src="../../images/OFF.png" style="zoom:75%;" /></span>"  
    &ensp;If the phone has text-to-speech capabilities it will speak each new reading

When enabling the feature, if Text to Speech is not already present on your device you will need to install it from the [Google Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.tts) or your phone vendor store.

!!!xdripitem "Install Text-To-Speech Data?"  
    Install Text-To-Speech Data?  
    (After installation of languages you might have to press "Restart Collector" in System Status.)  
    No &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;OK

You can decide to hear your glucose value in specific conditions (changes above a certain threshold) or periodically.

!!!xdripitem "When changes by (4 mgdl or mmol/l)"

!!!xdripitem "Or per number of minutes (4)"

Alerts can also be spoken if you enable this.

!!!xdripitem "Speak Alerts <span class='symbol'><img src="../../images/OFF.png" style="zoom:75%;" /></span>"  
    &ensp;Also give some spoken alert messages

You can have the trend being spoken, and have readings or all spoken information being pronounced twice.

!!!xdripitem "Speak trend arrow name <span class='symbol'><img src="../../images/EN.png" style="zoom:75%;" /></span>"

!!!xdripitem "Speak the glucose value twice each time <span class='symbol'><img src="../../images/DIS.png" style="zoom:75%;" /></span>"

!!!xdripitem "Speak everything twice <span class='symbol'><img src="../../images/DIS.png" style="zoom:75%;" /></span>"

If you want to force the readings in another language, you can select it by manually entering the language using the [ISO639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) code (example `de`) and eventually an underscore (`_`) followed by a locale as defined by [ISO3166-1 alpha 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements) (example `en_IN`).

!!!xdripitem "Custom locale for Spoken readings, e.g. de or en_IN"

You can modify the voice tone and reading speed.

!!!xdripitem "Speech speed"

!!!xdripitem "Speech pitch"

And eventually add a shortcut to the main menu.

!!!xdripitem "Speak Reading Shortcut <span class='symbol'><img src="../../images/DIS.png" style="zoom:75%;" /></span>"  
    &ensp;Show a shortcut in the â˜° menu to to toggle Speak Readings
