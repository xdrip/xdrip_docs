xDrip+ provides an easy way to copy settings from one phone to another.

### Show Settings QR Code

Show settings QR code displays a QR code containing xDrip+ settings.

!!!xdrip "`Show Settings QR Code`"  
    <img src="../../images/hamburger_menu.png" style="zoom:75%;" />  
    &ensp;<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/master/app/src/main/res/drawable-xhdpi/ic_qrcode_grey600_48dp.png" style="width:5%;" />&ensp;Show settings QR code

!!!xdripitem "Share Settings via QR code"  
    &ensp;Use QR codes to transfer settings->Auto configure feature

xDrip+ security key is used for xDrip+ Sync, if you only want to share a a follower code (that is difficult to copy manually) use this.

!!!xdripitem "**`XDRIP PLUS SECURITY KEY SETTINGS ONLY`**"

General and collection settings include general settings and your hardware data source settings.

!!!xdripitem "**`SHOW GENERAL AND COLLECTION SETTINGS`**"

All settings include all (not alarms: you need to recreate them manually).

!!!xdripitem "**`COPY ALL SETTINGS`**"

You will obtain a QR code that you can scan with Auto Configure on another phone.

### Auto Configure

Auto configure allows you to import settings from a QR code.

Make sure you know the origin of the QR code you will scan is safe.

!!!xdrip "`Auto Configure`"  
    <img src="../../images/hamburger_menu.png" style="zoom:75%;" />  
    &ensp;<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/master/app/src/main/res/drawable-xhdpi/ic_qrscan.png" style="width:5%;" />&ensp;Auto Configure

#### Camera

!!!xdripitem "Camera"  
    &ensp;Scan a QR code with your mobile (recommended)

You need to authorize xDrip+ to access the phone camera.

You can then scan the QR code displayed on another phone in order to copy the settings you selected when displaying it as explained [above](#show-settings-qr-code).

Current settings will be overwritten, a list will be displayed for you to acknowledge.

!!!xdripitem "Are you sure?"  
    &ensp;Only import settings from sources you trust!  
    &ensp;Please confirm to import the following settings:  
      
    setting1  
    setting2  
    setting3  
      
    `No` &emsp;&emsp;`Yes`

You might need to restart your phone to apply the changes.

#### Image file

If your phone has a bad quality or no video camera, you can load the QR code from a file.

You first need to save the QR code image you need to scan in your own pictures.

!!!xdripitem "Image file"  
    &ensp;You can save a QR code as an image file (such as .png or .jpeg) on your mobile. Then, use this option to scan the QR code from the saved file.

Select the image containing the QR code.

<img src="../../use/images/M-S-SY3.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

Current settings will be overwritten, a list will be displayed for you to acknowledge.

!!!xdripitem "Are you sure?"  
    &ensp;Only import settings from sources you trust!  
    &ensp;Please confirm to import the following settings:  
      
    setting1  
    setting2  
    setting3
