xDrip+ provides an easy way to copy settings from one phone to another.

### Show Settings QR Code

Show settings QR code displays a QR code containing xDrip+ settings.

!!!xdrip "<img src="../../images/hamburger_menu.png" style="zoom:75%;" />"  
    &ensp;<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/master/app/src/main/res/drawable-xhdpi/ic_qrcode_grey600_48dp.png" style="width:5%;" />&ensp;Show settings QR code

!!!xdrip "Share Settings via QR code"  
    &ensp;Use QR codes to transfer settings->Auto configure feature

xDrip+ security key is used for xDrip+ Sync, if you only want to share a a follower code (that is difficult to copy manually) use this.

!!!xdrip "<div style="background-color: gray; color: white; text-align: center;">  &emsp;XDRIP PLUS SECURITY KEY SETTINGS ONLY&emsp;</div>"

If you used customization QR codes for this phone xDrip+ (G7, 1+, BlueJay, ...), you can transfer them directly to another phone

!!!xdrip "<div style="background-color: gray; color: white; text-align: center;">  &emsp;EXPORT KEKS KEY TO ANOTHER PHONE&emsp;</div>"

General and collection settings include general settings and your hardware data source settings.

!!!xdrip "<div style="background-color: gray; color: white; text-align: center;">  &emsp;SHOW GENERAL AND COLLECTION SETTINGS&emsp;</div>"

All settings include all (not alarms: you need to recreate them manually).

!!!xdrip "<div style="background-color: gray; color: white; text-align: center;">  &emsp;COPY ALL SETTINGS&emsp;</div>"

You will obtain a QR code that you can scan with Auto Configure on another phone.

### Auto Configure

Make sure you know the origin of the QR code you will scan is safe.

!!!xdrip "<img src="../../images/hamburger_menu.png" style="zoom:75%;" />"  
    &ensp;<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/master/app/src/main/res/drawable-xhdpi/ic_qrscan.png" style="width:5%;" />&ensp;Auto Configure

#### Camera

!!!xdripitem "Camera"  
    &ensp;Scan a QR code with your mobile (recommended)

You need to authorize xDrip+ to access the phone camera.

You can then scan the QR code displayed on another phone in order to copy the settings you selected when displaying it as explained [above](#show-settings-qr-code).

    &emsp;setting1  
    &emsp;setting2  
    &emsp;setting3
