Many items can be added to this menu, by default you'll find the following ones:

`Home Screen` just returns to the main view.

[`System Status`](../../troubleshoot/systemstatus/) shows internal information on your data source, sharing, smartwatch status.

[`Snooze Alert`](../alarms/#snooze-alert) will give you options to snooze or disable alerts.

[`Statistics`](../statistics/) provide basic statistics.

[`History`](#history) allows you to browse previous days data.

[`Settings`](../settings/) opens the settings menu.

Additionally if can show more entries if you add items or when you use a sensor.

You will see sensor actions if you use xDrip+ directly connected to a sensor, also on xDrip+ Sync follower if the master is.

`Start Sensor` or `Stop Sensor` refer to your [sensor](../../install/datasource/#sensor-selection) relative section before using these functions.

!!!warning  
    xDrip+ Sync follower can transmit Start or Stop sensor and calibrations remotely.  
    Be extremely careful when using these features on a follower.

For Bluetooth bridges ([G4](../../install/G4/) and [Libre](../../install/libreBT/)) you will also see `Scan Bluetooth`.

`Level Alerts` will show if enabled in [Alerts and Alarms](../alarms/#glucose-level-alert-list).

`BG Data Table`, `Calibration Graph` and `Calibration Data Table` should be [added](../lesscommon) if you use [xDrip+ calibration algorithm](../../calibrate/calibrate/#native-and-xdrip-algorithms).

### History

When xDrip+ has been in use for some time, history allows you to browse old data.
