!!!xdrip "<img src="../../images/hamburger_menu.png" style="zoom:75%;" />"

Many items can be added to this menu, by default you'll find the following ones:

**Home Screen** just returns to the main view.

[**System Status**](../../troubleshoot/systemstatus/) shows internal information on your data source, sharing, smartwatch status.

[**Snooze Alert**](../alarms/#snooze-alert) will give you options to snooze or disable alerts.

[**Statistics**](../statistics/) provide basic statistics.

[**History**](#history) allows you to browse previous days data.

[**Settings**](../settings/) opens the settings menu.

Additionally it can show more entries if you add items or when you use a sensor:  
You will see sensor actions if you use xDrip+ directly connected to a sensor, also on xDrip+ Sync follower if the master is.

**[Start Sensor](../startsensor)** or **[Stop Sensor](../stopsensor)** refer to your [sensor](../../install/datasource/#sensor-selection) relative section before using these functions.

!!!warning  
    xDrip+ Sync follower can transmit Start or Stop sensor (if supported by the sensor) and calibrations, remotely.  
    Be extremely careful when using these features on a follower if the master xDrip+ accepts follower actions.

For Bluetooth bridges ([Libre](../../install/libreBT/)) you will also see **Scan Bluetooth**.

**Level Alerts** will show if enabled in [Alerts and Alarms](../alarms/#glucose-level-alert-list).

**BG Data Table**, **Calibration Graph** and **Calibration Data Table** should be manually [added](../lesscommon) if you use [xDrip+ calibration algorithm](../../calibrate/calibrate/#native-and-xdrip-algorithms).

### History

When xDrip+ has been in use for some time, history allows you to browse old data.

!!!xdripitem "History"  

1. browse the previous number of day(s)
2. browse the next number of day(s)
3. define the number of days displayed on the screen (from 1 to 14)
4. enable or disable statistics
