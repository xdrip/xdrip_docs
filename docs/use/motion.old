Motion tracking is used to detect vehicle mode and add functions when driving your car.

!!!xdripitem "Enable motion tracking<span class='symbol'><img src="../../images/OFF.png" style="zoom:75%;" /></span>"  
    &ensp;Use sensors to detect types of motion

You can track motion on your main graph.

!!!xdripitem "Log and plot motion <span class='symbol'><img src="../../images/EN.png" style="zoom:75%;" /></span>"  
    &ensp;Log recent motion types and plot these on the main graph

As for xDrip+ sync you can define which phone will actually send the motion information: it will be the motion master, only one device can be master. You can setup a device to be follower to motion in order to monitor remotely the master device motion.

!!!xdripitem "Use remote motion <span class='symbol'><img src="../../images/DIS.png" style="zoom:75%;" /></span>"  
    &ensp;Motion data taken from remote rather than local handset source

!!!xdripitem "Act as motion master <span class='symbol'><img src="../../images/DIS.png" style="zoom:75%;" /></span>"  
    &ensp;Be the master for motion data even if we are a follower. Set this on only one handset!

Vehicle mode enables more options.

!!!xdripitem "Enable vehicle mode<span class='symbol'><img src="../../images/OFF.png" style="zoom:75%;" /></span>"  
    &ensp;When vehicle is detected enable extra features

You can enable automatically vehicle mode when connecting to your car Bluetooth audio system.  
You can also set it manually by identifying your car audio Bluetooth connection.

!!!xdripitem "Detect car audio<span class='symbol'><img src="../../images/OFF.png" style="zoom:75%;" /></span>"  
    &ensp;Automatically enable vehicle mode when connected to car Bluetooth

!!!xdripitem "Learn current car audio"  
    &ensp;Tap to set the currently connected car audio device

Raising the low level alarm will allow you to be informed at a higher level than setup in alarms.

!!!xdripitem "Raise 'Low threshold' <span class='symbol'><img src="../../images/DIS.png" style="zoom:75%;" /></span>"  
    &ensp;Increase the level at which Low alarms will be triggered when in vehicle mode

You can make xDrip+ automatically enable spoken readings when driving.

!!!xdripitem "Speak readings <span class='symbol'><img src="../../images/DIS.png" style="zoom:75%;" /></span>"  
    &ensp;Enable speak readings feature when in vehicle mode

You can have a sound played when switching to motion detection mode and a reminder sound every 90 minutes. 

!!!xdripitem "Play sound <span class='symbol'><img src="../../images/EN.png" style="zoom:75%;" /></span>"  
    &ensp;Notification sound when vehicle mode detected

!!!xdripitem "Repeat sound <span class='symbol'><img src="../../images/EN.png" style="zoom:75%;" /></span>"  
    &ensp;Repeat notification sound every 90 minutes if still in vehicle mode
