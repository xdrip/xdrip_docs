You also can access it from the 3 dots menu:  `Import Export features` then `Load/Save settings`

<img src="../../images/3dots_menu.png" style="zoom:75%;" /> 

!!!xdripitem "Import Export features >" 

!!!xdripitem "Load/Save settings" 

You will find all options in this view.

!!!xdripitem "Load/Save Settings"  
    Here, you can save the settings to the internal storage (Download/xDrip-export/com.eveningoutpost.dexdrip_preferences.xml).  
    Once saved to a file, it is potentially possible for any app to read the settings which might contain sensitive information.  
    You are advised to delete the settings once you have imported them again if you are concerned about this.  
    

### Save Settings

<div style="background-color: gray; color: white; text-align: center;">  &emsp;Save all settings to the settings file&emsp;</div> 

Your settings will be saved in `/storage/emulated/0/Download/xDrip-Export` for old versions (export to SD) or in the `Download/xDrip-export` folder for recent versions   
You need to authorize xDrip+ to access your phone memory.

If you want to keep a safe copy, send yourself  the file by email, save in on a cloud drive or copy it via USB to a computer.

### Load Settings

<div style="background-color: gray; color: white; text-align: center;">  &emsp;Load all settings to the settings file&emsp;</div> 

!!!warning "Existing settings will be overwritten"

You might need to restart your phone to complete the operation.

### Delete Settings

<div style="background-color: gray; color: white; text-align: center;">  &emsp;Delete settings folder (Download/xDrip-Export)&emsp;</div> 

Exported settings contain private information, once transferred to another phone or a safe location you might want to delete the backup.
