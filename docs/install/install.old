Once downloaded, install the xDrip+ apk.

On recent Android versions you will see a Google Play Protect warning that the app is unsafe, was built for older Android versions. Ignore it with More details then, Install anyway.

**You need to [authorize installation of apps from unknown sources](https://developer.android.com/distribute/marketing-tools/alternative-distribution#unknown-sources) in Android security settings.**  
The official versions of xDrip+ are virus and malware free: being open source and controlled by the main developer make its distribution safe if you download it from GitHub.

Once installed, open xDrip+.

### Authorize background activity

xDrip+ must have the right to run in background: it must be whitelisted to battery optimization. This is essential to a correct functioning. It should ask you to allow this authorization. If it doesn't or you need to verify this later, you'll have to check it in your phone `Settings` - `Apps` - `xDrip+`. Consult your phone manual as  it will depend on Android version and manufacturer.

!!!xdripitem "Please allow Permission"  
    &emsp;xDrip+ needs whitelisting for proper performance.  
      
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<span style="background-color: white; color: black;">&ensp;OK&ensp;</span>

<img src="../images/Install07.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

*Note: With Android 12 and above you won't see **whitelisting** anymore.*

More information [here](../../troubleshoot/savings/#apps-battery-savings).

</br>

### Authorize notifications

xDrip+ needs to access phone notifications to perform as expected.

<img src="../images/Install47.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

</br>

## Verify which version is installed

Touch the back button on your phone until you're back to the main screen. Select the hamburger menu top left then `System Status`.

!!!xdrip "<img src="../../images/hamburger_menu.png" style="zoom:75%;" />"  
    &ensp;  System Status

Current version will be displayed after `Version`. In the example below, January 28th 2022.

<img src="../../images/M-SS-Ver.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

On most recent versions, you will find it on all system status pages.

<img src="../../images/M-SS-Ver2.png" style="zoom:76%;" />

See [here](../../use/update/) for upgrade or downgrade.

</br>

## Make sure xDrip+ will not be put to sleep

These settings are default, but still make sure they are exactly like shown below. Any time your phone will update, come back and check again: disable and enable checkboxes that should be enabled to enforce the settings.

!!!xdrip "<img src="../../images/hamburger_menu.png" style="zoom:75%;" />"  
    &ensp;Settings  
    &emsp;Less Common Settings  
    &ensp;&emsp;Other misc. Options  

!!!xdripitem "Run Collector in foreground <span class='symbol'><img src="../../images/EN.png" style="zoom:75%;" /></span>"  
    &ensp;Shows a persistent notification graph, visible on lock-screen and prevents Android from killing the service.

`Run Collector in Foreground` enables the graph in your phone drop down curtain but is **essential** to keep the app alive. It **must be enabled**.

!!!xdripitem "Battery Optimization prompt <span class='symbol'><img src="../../images/DIS.png" style="zoom:75%;" /></span>"  
    &ensp;On Android 6+ ensure battery optimization is switched off (recommended).

`Battery optimization prompt` should be **disabled** as you should have agreed to [battery whitelisting](#authorize-background-activity) during install. If not, whitelist xDrip+ from battery optimization in Android settings.

!!!xdripitem "Wake workarounds <span class='symbol'><img src="../../images/EN.png" style="zoom:75%;" /></span>"  
    &ensp;Use workarounds to avoid non-standard Android behavior of some handsets. Without this, collectors usually fail to get data.

Previously "Samsung workaround", this option is a fix to non compliance from some vendors to Android specifications. This option should enable automatically with some smartphones. Recommended.

### Enable location

For newer Android versions (6 and above), location is [mandatory](https://developer.android.com/training/location/permissions) to allow Bluetooth Low Energy connection.  
If you will use xDrip+ with a Bluetooth sensor or bridge you **must** enable location (Android Settings -> [Location](https://support.google.com/android/answer/3467281)) and authorize xDrip+ to access it. Consult your phone manual as it will depend on Android version and manufacturer.

Make sure to select All the time from settings.
