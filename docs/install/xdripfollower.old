!!!warning "Old xDrip+ Sync"  
    In July 2024, Google shutdown the deprecated the [Firebase API](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/migrate-v1) xDrip+ used for xDrip+ Sync.  
    Update xDrip+ to a version at least [July 23rd 2024](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/releases/tag/2024.07.23) to use the legacy Sync method.  
    Updating xDrip+ to minimum latest release is recommended.

Select this data source if you've setup a device with xDrip+ as master and decided this other device will be the follower.  
A master device is usually the one getting BG from the sensor.  
A follower replicates readings from the master device real time (network latency applies).

There is virtually no limit in the amount of xDrip+ follower devices.

See [here](../../use/syncsetup) how to setup xDrip+ Sync follower.
