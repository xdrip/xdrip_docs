If you're using the vendor app, you can have xDrip+ get sensor data from it.

This feature is available for:

- G6/G7 (master only) apps
- 1/1+ (only if the app shows BG notifications) apps
- CamAPS app
- Guardian, MiniMed, Simplera apps
- Omnipod 5 app
- Eversense apps
- Micro tech LinX Aidex app
- Ottai Sens and Tag apps

In order to use this feature you **must** authorize xDrip+ to access notifications.

xDrip+ will not use this access for any other purpose than reading the glucose value from notifications.

!!!xdripitem "Please allow permission"  
      

    Permission is needed to receive data from other aplications. xDrip does not do anything beyond this scope. Please enable xDrip on the next screen.

If you cannot allow notification access, check the three dots menu in the app settings and chose Allow restricted settings.

You will get data in xDrip+ when available in the app and notifications from the app are visible on the phone.

If no data is visible and no error message pops-up you might need to [Start sensor](../../use/startsensor/#followers-and-companion-apps).
