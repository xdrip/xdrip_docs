    &emsp;Hardware Data Source  
    &ensp;&emsp;Libre (patched app)

The apps listed below use the same protocol to send data to xDrip+.

!!!note  
    External apps readings will be treated like sensor data in all effects, this includes [calibration limitations](../../calibrate/calibrate/#libre-2-patched-app).

It shouldn't be necessary anymore but if you don't see data in xDrip+ [Start sensor](../../use/startsensor/#followers-and-companion-apps).

#### Libre 2 EU [Patched App](../../troubleshoot/libre2/#patched-app)

!!!info "Patched app"  
    The patched app itself is only available for the European version of Libre 2.  
    Being an old app, it is **rarely compatible with Android versions above 12**.

#### Juggluco

If you use [Juggluco](https://www.juggluco.nl/Juggluco/index.html) you can broadcast to xDrip+ enabling Send to xDrip. You must have data streaming in Juggluco in order to see measurements in xDrip+.

#### Smoothing

This data source is subject to 25 minutes default smoothing. The smoothing period can be adjusted in the [NFC menu](../../use/NFC/#smooth-libre-3-data-when-using-xxx-method) to decrease the delay generated, if the noise level allows it.
