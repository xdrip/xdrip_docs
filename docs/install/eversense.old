!!!info "Eversense is also supported through [Companion App](../companion) data source" 

If you want to receive data from the Eversense app directly to xDrip+, you need the [modified](https://cr4ck3d3v3r53n53.club/) vendor app and [ESEL](https://github.com/BernhardRo/Esel/blob/master/apk/debug/app-debug.apk).

Original instructions [here](https://github.com/BernhardRo/Esel).
