# G4 setup

!!!note  "Legacy sensor/transmitter"  
    G4 sensors are compatible with G5 transmitters. Consider using a rebatteried transmitter.

</br>

G4 transmitters use radiofrequencies and not Bluetooth.

You need a bridge device to convert the signal to Bluetooth in order to be able to receive it with your phone.  
If you have a Dexcom Share receiver you can use it as a bridge.

If you're using a Wixel select the type:

[Bluetooth Wixel](https://github.com/StephenBlackWasAlreadyTaken/xDrip/wiki/xDrip-Wireless-Bridge)

If required (xBridge) enter the transmitter code.

Then pair it to Bluetooth using xDrip+: scan Bluetooth and select it from the list.

If you're using a Bluetooth G4 Share receiver (Platinum) you can also pair it with Bluetooth to xDrip+.  
Enter the receiver serial number or use the phone camera to scan the barcode (need to authorize camera access to xDrip+).

If you're using a Wifi Wixel, enter the list of receivers as a coma separated list.

Wifi Wixel + BT Wixel  
Wifi Wixel + Bridge Wixel

Once paired, Start Sensor from the main menu and indicate the time you started it with the receiver.
