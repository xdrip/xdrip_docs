    &ensp;&emsp;Dex Share Follower

### Prerequisites

In order for xDrip+ to receive data from share servers, you need to have:

1. a username that is **not a phone number**, create a [dependent account](https://www.dexcom.com/faqs/how-do-i-create-a-dependent-account) to obtain one. Once created the new dependent account, make sure you're logged with this account in your Dexcom apps and recreate all followers
2. sharing enabled on the Dex app that is connected to the sensor
3. accepted the invitation on the Dex follower app (you can uninstall it afterwards)

Enter the credentials you use to authenticate with Clarity.

!!!xdripitem "Share  Username"  
    &ensp;Login username for Dex Share following

!!!xdripitem "Share Password"  
    &ensp;Login password for Dex Share following

Only enable US servers if your account is in the USA.

!!!xdripitem "US Servers"  
    &ensp;Your account and follower app are from the USA

!!!warning "Account lock"  
    Leaving xDrip+ with a wrong password will lock your account.  
    In order to recover from an account lock, delete your credentials, [disable xDrip+ collection](../datasource/#changing-data-source) and wait for 15/20 minutes.  
    xDrip+ and any other third party app trying to connect with a bad password will maintain the locked state.

If no data is visible and no error message pops-up you might need to [Start sensor](../../use/startsensor/#followers-and-companion-apps).
