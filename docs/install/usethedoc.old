### Original documentation

This documentation is a collection of various sources, when applicable you will find links to the **original and reference documentation**.  
Always rely on the original documentation unless obsolete (will be mentioned).

### Translation

The documentation is only available in English.  
You might find it easier to follow if you [switch your xDrip+ to English](../../use/display/#language) and read it using and automatic translation with Google.

Most menu pictures have been changed to text to allow automatic translation, this means they might not match the display but hopefully they will point you to the right item.
