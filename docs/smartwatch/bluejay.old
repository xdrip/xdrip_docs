    &emsp;  BlueJay Watch

You can buy your BlueJay Watch [here: <img src="../images/M-S-SW-BJ1.png" style="zoom:100%;" />](https://bluejay.website/) 

Two new generations of BlueJay are available.  
X2 is not sold anymore.  
[GTS](https://bluejay.website/shop/product/bluejay-gts-26) can be setup without xDrip+ (only standalone) and also with xDrip+.  
[U1](https://bluejay.website/shop/product/bluejay-u1-27) is beta and runs the full xDrip+ package.  
[U2](https://bluejay.website/shop/product/bluejay-u2-28) is released.

!!!info "Sharing BG"  
    BlueJay X2/GTS are only Bluetooth and cannot share BG data without being connected to your phone xDrip+.

BlueJay watches are powerful companions for your G6, G7 and 1/1+ sensors. They connect directly to the transmitter but you need to be aware of the limitations.

##### G6/G7 and 1/1+

These transmitters have two Bluetooth slots: phone and non-phone.  
You can configure your slots as per the table below. Only two devices can be connected simultaneously to the transmitter, each one using a unique slot.  
By default BlueJay uses the non-phone slot. See [here for GTS](#run-collector) how to change this setting.

U1 and U2 need to be connected first to the sensor. Once connected, you can also enable the second connection and the watch will automatically select the available free slot.

*Note: xDrip+ uses the phone slot by default, non-phone slot requires engineering mode*

### Pair your watch to xDrip+ (X2 and GTS)

1 - Make sure the watch is charged before starting.

2 - Enable BlueJay and disable watch collector.  

!!!xdripitem "BlueJay Watch <span class='symbol'><img src="../../images/ON.png" style="zoom:75%;" /></span>" 

!!!xdripitem "Run Collector <span class='symbol'><img src="../../images/OFF.png" style="zoom:75%;" /></span>"  

3 - If you have a BlueJay GTS continue to 6.  
If you have a BlueJay X2 it should show a QR code on the screen.  
<img src="../images/M-S-SW-BJc5.png" style="zoom:40%;" />  
If you see it continue to 7.

4 - Launch BlueJay Panel and Scan.  
!!!xdripitem "Launch BlueJay Panel"   
<img src="../images/M-S-SW-BJc1.png" style="zoom:76%;" />  
When the watch is detected you should see its Mac address. Select it.  
<img src="../images/M-S-SW-BJc2.png" style="zoom:66%;" /></br>  
If xDrip+ doesn't find the watch, try to restart your phone and retry. If you still can't find it: you can enter the watch Mac address manually here   
!!!xdripitem "BlueJay Advanced Settings"  
    &ensp;BlueJay Mac

The QR code should now appear on the watch, if you see it: continue to 7.

5 - If the QR code didn't show-up on your watch, select QR and retry.  
<img src="../images/M-S-SW-BJc4.png" style="zoom:76%;" />  
If you still can't see the QR code try REBOOT then [contact](https://bluejay.website/contactus) the vendor for assistance or seek help [here](https://gitter.im/jamorham/BlueJay).

6 - On the GTS follow this menu sequence to display the QR code:  
Settings Menu -> Admin Menu -> Show QR Code  
<img src="../images/M-S-SW-BJc6.png" style="zoom:76%;" /> 

7 - In xDrip+ scan the watch QR code  
!!!xdrip "<img src="../../images/hamburger_menu.png" style="zoom:75%;" />"  
    &ensp;Auto Configure    
You need to authorize xDrip+ to access the phone camera.  
Scan the QR code displayed on the watch.  
<img src="../images/M-S-SW-BJc7.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

Setup the watch as a follower and you should see your BG within minutes.

!!!xdripitem "BlueJay Watch <span class='symbol'><img src="../../images/ON.png" style="zoom:75%;" /></span>" 

!!!xdripitem "Run Collector <span class='symbol'><img src="../../images/ON.png" style="zoom:75%;" /></span>"  

!!!xdripitem "Send Readings <span class='symbol'><img src="../../images/EN.png" style="zoom:75%;" /></span>" 

Check [System Status](../../troubleshoot/systemstatus/) to confirm the watch paired correctly. Swipe to the advanced status tab BlueJay.  

<img src="../images/M-S-SW-BJc8.png" style="zoom:66%;" />

If the xDrip core is not installed you should install it now.

### Install the xDrip Core 

!!!warning "Put the watch in charge whilst installing the core"

In xDrip+ System Status, BlueJay advanced status, tap the red line xDrip Core: Not Installed.

<img src="../images/M-S-SW-BJd1.png" style="zoom:71%;" />

Select OK to update the watch.

<img src="../images/M-S-SW-BJd2.png" style="zoom:79%;" />

Check System Status afterwards, you should see the core installed.

<img src="../images/M-S-SW-BJd3.png" style="zoom:66%;" />

### Run collector

Run collector means you will be using the watch without having necessarily your phone with you.

You must setup the watch using xDrip+ if you use an X2 model.  
For GTS you can do it directly through the watch [menu](https://bluejay.website/gts-menu-top), without using xDrip+.

In order to use the watch with xDrip+ you must have a transmitter directly connected to xDrip+ with BG data currently displaying in xDrip+.

Define which slot will connect to the transmitter. Refer to the table [above](#g6g7-and-11) to setup your slots.

!!!xdripitem "BlueJay Advanced Settings" 

##### Run Phone Collector

!!!xdripitem "Run Phone Collector <span class='symbol'><img src="../../images/ON.png" style="zoom:75%;" /></span>"  
    &ensp;Also run the standard collector on this phone. Only turn this off if you don't want this phone itself to be connecting to the transmitter.

Enables/disable the connection of xDrip+ to the transmitter (using the phone slot).

##### BlueJay uses Phone slot

!!!xdripitem "BlueJay uses Phone slot <span class='symbol'><img src="../../images/OFF.png" style="zoom:75%;" /></span>"  
    &ensp;This allows the BlueJay to occupy the phone slot on the transmitter. Select this if you want another non-phone device to be able to connect to the transmitter and you are not using a phone to connect to the transmitter.

By default BlueJay uses the non-phone slot. You can let it use the phone slot with this option but you should then disable Run Phone Collector above.

Once slots setup you can enable the watch as a standalone collector device.

!!!xdripitem "BlueJay Watch <span class='symbol'><img src="../../images/ON.png" style="zoom:75%;" /></span>" 

!!!xdripitem "Run Collector <span class='symbol'><img src="../../images/ON.png" style="zoom:75%;" /></span>"  

You will then see your phone xDrip+ is not connected to the transmitter anymore: BlueJay is.  
When your watch is within Bluetooth range, your phone should receive BG from BlueJay.

<img src="../images/M-S-SW-BJe4.png" style="zoom:66%;" />

## BlueJay GTS

GTS doesn't need xDrip+ to be setup but the steps above should also apply if you want to so so.

See the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM5cw-xVAZk) for a guided tour.

See here [how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YpjuZe2c_Q) to connect to the transmitter.
