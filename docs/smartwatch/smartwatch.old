## xDrip+ direct integration

xDrip+ offers a wide range of smartwatch support.

### [Android Wear Integration](../wear)

!!!xdripitem "Android Wear Integration" 

You'll find the most complete integration in Wear OS watches as they are running a part of the xDrip+ app locally.

The wear extension of xDrip+ is not under development anymore.

If you need more watchfaces or customizations you can use [Tasker](https://github.com/FreDiabetics/xDrip--Tasker-Tizen-Watchface-Integration/blob/master/README.md) (but not as a standalone collector).

### [Pebble Integration](../pebble)

!!!xdripitem "Pebble Integration" 

Pebble smartwatch use is a historic milestone of CGM in the Cloud. Pebble has been bought by Fitbit in 2016 and resources have moved to archives and [rebble.io](https://rebble.io/).

You need to download the watch app from [APKMirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/pebble-technology-corp/pebble/pebble-4-4-2-1405-62d45d7d7-endframe-release/pebble-4-4-2-1405-62d45d7d7-endframe-android-apk-download/).

### [AmazFit Sync Service](https://crazyinfo.de/2018/07/25/xdrip-smartwatch-widget-fuer-amazfit-pace-stratos/)

!!!xdripitem "AmazFit Sync Service" 

AmazFit was used only for Pace and Stratos models.  
**You cannot use this feature for other AmazFit watches.**

### [BlueJay Watch](../bluejay)

!!!xdripitem "BlueJay Watch" 

BlueJay is an incredible companion of your Dexcom sensor, with or without xDrip+, with or without phone.

### [LeFun Band](https://www.lefunsmart.com/collections/smartwatches)

!!!xdripitem "LeFun Band" 

LeFun band integration was an early implementation for smartbands, best if used in mmol/l.  
Unless you still own a LeFun W3, F3, F3S, F11 or F12 band this is not of any use now.

### [MiBand](../miband)

!!!xdripitem "MiBand" 

MiBand integration is the result of the huge work of [Artem](https://bigdigital.home.blog/).  
Many smartwatches and smartbands are now supported using the companion app WatchDrip+.

!!!note "Disable MiBand in xDrip+ if you use WatchDrip+"  
    !!!xdripitem "Use MiBand <span class='symbol'><img src="../../images/OFF.png" style="zoom:75%;" /></span>" 

## Smartwatch Sensors

xDrip+ can use supported smartwatches sensors.

!!!xdripitem "Use Health data <span class='symbol'><img src="../../images/ON.png" style="zoom:75%;" /></span>" 

xDrip+ can request the heartbeat sensor to activate and you can smooth that graph.

!!!xdripitem "Heart Rate Sensor <span class='symbol'><img src="../../images/ON.png" style="zoom:75%;" /></span>"

When available you can let xDrip+ collect health data like heartrate and steps.

Two additional icons will appear on the main view, and if enabled, graphic representations:

1.  A dark blue graph for heartrate
2. A light cyan cloud line for steps

## Other smartwatches

More smartwatches and devices can receive data from xDrip+ even if they are not directly integrated in the app.

!!!info  
    In order to have xDrip+ send data you need to enable xDrip+ [web service](../../use/interapp#web-service).

### Android Wear

[GlucoDataHandler](https://github.com/pachi81/GlucoDataHandler) accepts xDrip+ as a data source. The app is available in [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.michelinside.glucodatahandler).

### Android Auto

[GlucoDataAuto](https://github.com/pachi81/GlucoDataAuto) is the Android Auto extension of GlucoDataHandler.

### Fitbit

!!!warning "Google is discontinuing Sense/Ionic/Versa"  
    Consider these products will be end of life in the near future.

!!!warning "Not available for EU users"  
    Google has [removed](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237121?hl=en) the possibility since June 2024. Installed watchfaces are not impacted but new users can't install custom watchfaces anymore. You need to use a VPN as a workaround.

!!!warning "Android 9 and below"  
    Android users with a version below 10 need to downgrade the Fitbit app to a previous version like 3.58 and disable automatic updates. You can find it in [Aptoide](https://fitbit.en.aptoide.com/versions) and other apk hosting servers.

You can also use [Tasker](https://github.com/FreDiabetics/xDrip--Tasker-Tizen-Watchface-Integration/blob/master/README.md) to display xDrip+ data on your Samsung Gear watch.

### Garmin

Many Garmin watchfaces are available, check your model is supported.
