    &emsp;  MiBand

xDrip+ Official Release supports MiBand 2, 3, 4 and broadcast to [WatchDrip+](https://bigdigital.home.blog/2022/06/16/watchdrip-a-new-application-for-xdrip-watch-integration) for other smartbands.

!!!note "Prerequisite"  
    Make sure you have BG readings in xDrip+ before trying to have them on your watch.  
    If xDrip+ doesn't receive readings on your phone, they won't be displayed on the watch.

## Install

### Obtain an authentication key

#### If you already paired your watch with the vendor app

- Unpair the watch.
- Uninstall MiFit or Zepp, or whatever app you used to connect your watch.

- **Delete the old key files** (use a file browser on your phone) in the phone memory `freemyband` folder.  
  Recommended if you can't get xDrip+ to connect to the watch.  
  *Note: the name below is an example*

#### Install the patched app matching your watch

Go to [https://www.freemyband.com/](https://www.freemyband.com/)

Download and install [Zepp](https://www.freemyband.com/2019/08/amazfit-gtr-auth-key.html) for Amazfit watches.  
(or)  
Download and install [MiFit](https://www.freemyband.com/2019/08/mi-band-4-auth-key.html) for Xiaomi smartbands.

Authenticate with mail and password. Create an account if necessary.

Pair your smartband.

Enable watch visibility. If you don't find this option make sure you have set your age to 18 and above.

Check a key file was created in the phone memory `freemyband` folder.

You can uninstall the patched app. This is not mandatory. If you want to install the original app, use the same email account to login.

## Not using WatchDrip+

!!!note "Only MiBand 2, 3 and 4"

### Setup xDrip+

Switch the MiBand feature on. Keep your watch close to your phone until it gets detected.

!!!xdripitem "Use MiBand <span class='symbol'><img src="../../images/ON.png" style="zoom:75%;" /></span>" 

<img src="../images/M-S-SW-MB-I1.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

Mac Address should populate automatically.

!!!xdripitem "Mac address (FF:EE:DD:CC:BB:AA)"  
    &ensp;Leave empty for auto search

**If it doesn't** (unexpected)**:**   
Delete the file(s) in the  `freemyband` folder.  
Open the patched watch app.  
Retry: switch off then on the MiBand feature.

You can also try to enter the watch mac address manually. You will find it in the filename in the `freemyband` folder.  
For example if the name is `mibandFFEEDDCCBBAA.txt` the corresponding mac address will be `FF:EE:DD:CC:BB:AA`.

<img src="../images/M-S-SW-MB-I2.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

Keep an eye on toast messages: during smartwatch authentication you should see the following:

<img src="../images/M-S-SW-MB-I3.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

If authorization fails, delete the file(s) in the `freemyband` folder and open the patched app to regenerate it.

<img src="../images/M-S-SW-MB-I4.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

If xDrip+ can't get the authentication key automatically, you can try to insert it manually. You will find it editing the file.

<img src="../images/M-S-SW-MB-I5.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

Make sure the watch is connected and matches the mac address before manually entering the key.

!!!xdripitem "Auth Key"

Once connected and authenticated, enable Send Readings. Wait for the next value in xDrip+, the watchface should update.

!!!xdripitem "Send readings <span class='symbol'><img src="../../images/ON.png" style="zoom:75%;" /></span>"   
    &ensp;Appropriate the watch date to show glucose values. Better with mmol/l - see documentation
