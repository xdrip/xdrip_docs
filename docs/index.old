Bluetooth Glucose Meters such as the Contour Next One, AccuChek Guide, Verio Flex & Diamond Mini as well as devices like the Pendiq 2.0 Insulin Pen.

Heart-rate and step counter data is processed from Android Wear, Garmin, Fitbit and Pebble smart-watches and watch-faces for those that show glucose values and graphs.

The app contains sophisticated charting, customization and data entry features as well as a predictive simulation model.

Instant two-way synchronization is possible by linking follower handsets, data can also be uploaded and downloaded to a Nightscout web service or uploaded directly to Tidepool, MongoDB or InfluxDB.

Customization allows for different options to configure alarms, vocalize readings, change the display preferences etc. International users can update translations from within the app too.

Your data is yours and can be exported in many different ways. xDrip also intercommunicates with other apps, for example sending and receiving live data with [AndroidAPS](https://androidaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

## History

[DexDrip](https://github.com/StephenBlackWasAlreadyTaken/DexDrip)  was created by Emma Black in 2014 and then became [xDrip](http://stephenblackwasalreadytaken.github.io/xDrip/), an app collecting CGM data from a G4 receiver or a bridge device and sending them to [Nightscout](https://nightscout.github.io/).  It also came with the follower app [Nightwatch](http://stephenblackwasalreadytaken.github.io/NightWatch/) (obsolete).

This project was then modified by @jamorham to become [xDrip+](https://jamorham.github.io/#xdrip-plus).
